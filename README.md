# Profiling API Services
This is a project for profiling all of the API services across the sector who are putting API specifications to work, defining as individual YAML entries in [the API Specification Toolbox website](http://api.specificationtoolbox.com/). Providing a human and machine readable list of API service providers consumers can choose from when it comes to delivering APIs across the API lifecycle.

We are just getting going tracking on the news for the space and adding them to the API Specificaiton Toolbox. Feel free to submit services to [the API Specification Toolbox via a GitHub issue, or via pull request on the repository. Ultimately we are looking to automate as much of this work as possible, while maintaining a critical human expert curation before it gets published and syndicated here.

We are using this README to manage this project, and Github issues to manage the conversation and all of the work that occurs around defining all of the areas of this work. If you have any contributions feel free to submit an issue or a pull request on this project, or any other in the API Specification toolbox, including the toolbox itself.
